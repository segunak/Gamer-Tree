# Gamer Tree
*Lindenwood University's tournament management system.*

## Purpose 
Lindenwood University's Multimedia Center hosts a number of game tournaments (video games, board games, challenges, etc.) that from an organizational standpoint, were managed via sign up sheets, group texts and mass email chains. This project provided a tournament management system to streamline and significantly improve the process of managing game and game-like events hosted by the University throughout the school year.

## Technology
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end. 
* Server side scripting in PHP. 
* Database management via AWS & MySQL. 

## Website 
The tournament management system, as used and hosted by Lindenwood University, is not public facing. 

However, some of the design and features can be observed at https://akintundejr4.github.io/Gamer-Tree/. Those seeking to get a rough (very rough) demonstration of the application can login using the credentials `guest` as both username and password.
